  <i>
    JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained <br> way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted <br>because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) <br>or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
